		<h2>Getting Started Guide</h2>
		<p class="grey-text">This guide is intended as a quick-start for getting the bot set up with customizable settings for your server.</p>
		<p>All of the features listed here are off by default, so you don't have to worry about anything being out of order.</p>
		<blockquote>IMPORTANT NOTE: It is recommended to give the bot the ADMINISTRATOR permission so that it has the correct permissions required in order to perform its interactions with the server and the server members.</blockquote>
		<hr>
		<h4>Terms of Service</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Feature that displays customizable terms of service (or rules list) in a channel, and gives new users a "default" role when they accept the terms.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!tos (channel|title|body|list|status) (#channelMention | message number) (text)</code></p>
		<p>This feature has multiple steps to set up:
			<ol>
				<li>Set up the title and body text for each block of text for your rules/tos list.</li>
				<li>Set up the channel to display the rules in. We recommend setting up a channel that you have as your main invite for new members, and making it so new members can only see the content in this channel and no others.</li>
				<li>Set that channel as the tos channel by running: <code>!tos channel #channelMention</code></li>
				<li>Go into that channel, and run: <code>!tos list</code> to list out all the tos/rules blocks you set previously.</li>
				<li>Set up a default role that grants users access to all the other basic channels in your server. This way new users are behind a wall until they accept your rules/tos</li>
				<li>Then add this role as the default by running: <code>!role default @roleMention</code></li>
				<li>Lastly, set the channel for accepting the tos/rules accept command by running: <code>!accept #channelMention</code>. This sets the channel (your rules/tos channel from the previous part), for new users to type <code>!accept</code> and then be granted access to your server.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h4>Welcome Message</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Welcomes a new user to your server with a customizable message.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!welcome <message|channel|enable|disable> (text | #channelMention)</code></p>
		<p>Enable this feature, then set the welcome message to your liking, and don't forget to set the channel for the messages to appear!</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Goodbye Message</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Informs a channel of a user's departure from your server with a customizable message.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!goodbye <message|channel|enable|disable> (text | #channelMention)</code></p>
		<p>Enable this feature, then set the goodbye message to your liking, and don't forget to set the channel for the messages to appear!</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Delete Command Messages</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Automatically delete the calling message when a command is run. This helps keep chat free of junk messages.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!deletecommandmessages <enable|disable></code></p>
		<p>Go ahead and simply enable or disable this feature.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Self-Assignable Roles</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Allow users to self assign roles from a list of approved ones.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!role <add|remove|list> (@roleMention)</code></p>
		<p>Setup of this feature is pretty straightforward. After setting a few roles for your members to add for themselves, they can add/remove them by running: <code>!iam/!iamnot @roleMention</code></p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Moderator Log</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Logs all moderation-related actions to a channel for recordkeeping.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!modlog <enable|disable></enable></code></p>
		<p>This is a great feature for keeping track of what's going on in your server, rather than sifting through the audit log. Easy to set up, too!</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Bot Command Prefix</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Change the bot's command prefix.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!prefix (prefix|none|default)</code></p>
		<p>This one is pretty straightforward. Some people prefer using a different prefix to use Spudnik.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Embed Color</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Customize the color of the response embed from the bot.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!embedcolor (hex color)</code></p>
		<p>This one is pretty straightforward. Change the color, or don't.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Bot Nickname</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Change the bot's nickname on your server.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!nick (new nickname)</code></p>
		<p>Another straightforward one. Spudnik is also known as Sir Taterpants in some circles.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Adblocker</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Automatically delete any message containing an invite to another Discord server, unless posted by an Administrator.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!adblock <enable|disable></code></p>
		<p>Go ahead and simply enable or disable this feature.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Starboard</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- Feature that saves messages to a specified channel for archiving when one is reacted to with a customizable emoji.</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!starboard <status|channel|trigger|enable|disable> (new starboard emoji | #channelMention)</code></p>
		<p>Keep in mind when setting the reaction trigger emoji, currently only official emojis are supported.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Enable/Disable Commands</h4>
		<p class="grey-text">- You can enable/disable individual commands or entire command groups!</p>
		<p>syntax: <code>!disable/!enable <command|commandGroup></code></p>
		<p>Command groups can be seen by running: <code>!groups</code></p>
